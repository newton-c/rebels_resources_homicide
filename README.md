# Rebels, Resources and Homicide

This repository contains the replication files for "Rebels, Resoursces, and Homicide", a project I'm working on as part of my disseretation. 
The question is whether rebel groups which use illicit resources during a conflict increase violece postconflict through a shift from using illicit resources to fund political objectives to creating a purely criminal enterprise.
